### Education
#### University 										     2017-2021
Queen Mary University of London
Degree: Digital and Technology Solutions (Software Engineer) (graduation in June 2021)
Level 6 apprenticeship (equivalent to degree)

##### Final Year Project
Used Python, SVM and Random Forest (Scikit-Learn) and React to create a Full Stack Machine Learning application that analysed the sentiment of paragraphs within a BBC article. This was a brand new area for the BBC, allowing the organisation to begin using software to aid the judgement of impartiality. The machine learning algorithm acted as a backend and the responses were integrated into the React web application that I had worked on for the previous 3 years at the BBC.
